1. Implementation Overview
The experiment combines ECG feature extraction, knowledge retrieval (RAG), and LLM inference to diagnose ECG abnormalities. It consists of:

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Raw ECG signal acquisition
Noise filtering & normalization
Knowledge Base Construction

Extracting text embeddings from medical literature
Storing them in ChromaDB for similarity-based retrieval
Feature Extraction

Extracting meaningful ECG features (P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave)
Using Fourier Transforms or deep learning-based methods
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Matching user queries (or ECG features) with similar cases in the knowledge base
Creating prompts for the LLM
LLM Inference for Diagnosis

Feeding structured prompts into the LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Med-PaLM)
Generating a diagnosis
Evaluation & Validation

Comparing LLM outputs with expert-labeled ECG interpretations
Using metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, Specificity

2. Code Implementation
Now, I’ll provide a structured Python codebase to implement the above steps. I’ll include:

✅ ECG Preprocessing (Denoising, Normalization)
✅ Embedding Creation & Storage (ChromaDB)
✅ Feature Extraction
✅ RAG-based Prompt Generation
✅ LLM-based Diagnosis

Let me set up the codebase for you.
